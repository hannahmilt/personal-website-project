		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<p> My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections.</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Brief Hello. This section will state my name and my role as a Web Developer. This section will have a picture
				as the background. Feature idea: for the background picture I want to see if I can get it to pop over the frame to look more
				3D (plant) or just have Sandia mountains for background hazy or translucent</p>
			<h2>Directory Bar</h2>
				<p>Will have list of sections (About Me, Skills, Portfolio, Connect) with links
				so you can jump to said labeled  section. Feature idea: As you hover over section it will either pop out more or highlight
				to a different color.</p>
			<h2>Information About Me</h2>
				<p>This Section will detail my professional learning history (coding-bootcamp), core skill set. Will highlight strengths and
				personality. On the left side I will include a picture of me. On the right side will be text. Feature idea: Would like the picture
				 to be shaped like a circle with a border.</p>
			<h2>My Skills</h2>
				<p>Re-highlight skills with a bar sliding graphic labeling Html, Php, Css, and MySQL. (not really sure if i need this. noticed
				a lot of the portfolios had this in them. Feature idea: Background should be similar to introduction.</p>
			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
				<p>Image gallery containing examples of my work (my not have anything to put in this in beginning). Feature idea: pictures
				pop out slightly when mouse hovers over them.</p>
			<h2>Connect With Me</h2>
				<p> Icon graphics that link to my github, Linkdin, and Email. So employers can reach out to me. Feature idea: would like the icons
				to pop up a web page link, or separate pop up for mail. Background should be similar to introduction.</p>
